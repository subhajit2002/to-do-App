# Simple TODO APP

This is a simple TODO app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks locally using the browser's localStorage feature. The app has an attractive user interface designed with HTML and CSS.

## Features

- Add tasks with a title and description.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Tasks are stored locally using browser localStorage, so they persist even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

## Usage

To use the app, simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

1. **Add a Task**: Click on the "Add Task" button to create a new task. Fill in the title and description, then click "Add" to save the task.
2. **Mark Task as Completed**: Click on the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed.
3. **Edit Task**: Click on the edit icon (pencil) next to a task to edit its title or description.
4. **Delete Task**: Click on the delete icon (trash can) next to a task to delete it.

## LocalStorage

The app utilizes the browser's localStorage to persist tasks locally. This means that tasks will still be available even if you close the browser or refresh the page. However, please note that localStorage is limited to the browser and device where the tasks were created.
